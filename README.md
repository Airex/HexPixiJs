HexPixiJs
=========
Basic Hex Grid For PixiJS

HexPixiJs is a simple library written to give hex grid based game developers a jump start. This library will be updated periodically but there is currently no roadmap of features. Feel free to request features.

Twitter Bootstrap 3 was used for the main demo page, but is not required to use HexPixiJs. 

Disclaimer
----------
This is not supposed to be and end-all solution for making hex grid based games. There is currently no documentation, but the code is fairly simple so I believe there is value for some developers. 

Troubleshooting
---------------
I realize there is a CORS (cross origin resource sharing) issue if you are trying to view this without a webserver. In otherwords, if you download the files and double click index.html, the texture might not load.

Files
-----
A brief list and description of the important project files:

* scripts/hexpixi.js -Contains the HexPixiJS library code.
* scripts/hpdemo.js - This javascript code sets up the main demo page and serves as an example of how to use HexPixiJS.
* index.html - The main demo page.
