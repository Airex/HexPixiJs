Basic Hex Grid For PixiJS

HexPixiJs is a simple library written to give hex grid based game developers a jump start. This is not supposed to be and end-all solution for making hex grid based games. 

This library will be updated periodically but there is currently no roadmap of features.  Feel free to request features.

Twitter Bootstrap 3 was used for the main demo page, but is not required.
